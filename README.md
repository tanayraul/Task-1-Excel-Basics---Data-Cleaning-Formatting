# Task-1-Excel-Basics---Data-Cleaning-Formatting

We were asked to get datasets from kraggle, so we got csv file of netflix movies and tv shows a
nd were asked to freeze top row which was easy to execute, then we adjusted column alt + hoi.We are asked to highlight blank spaces in the entire documents, so for that i had to select all and then press ctrl +G and alt+s then select blank spaces , then duplicate files were removed 
Learning about TRIM function and removing extra spaces to make the work more consistent.
Date formats were to be changed with no spelling variations should be observed. Created a Cleaned_Data sheet where all corrected work was put and we added another column named Data_Quality_Notes where we had to note any rating value inconsistencies to highlight analyst thinking in our task.
